# Setting up the game database :

You need to have a functional Python 3 installation to use the site. 

1. First install all the dependencies using the code below
>$ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Initialize the 5 necessary database, by running the SQL files
	  psql -d{database} -U{user} -f Favorites.sql
	  psql -d{database} -U{user} -f WishList.sql

	  psql -d{database} -U{user} -f Create VideoGame.sql
	  psql -d{database} -U{user} -f Create Users.sql
